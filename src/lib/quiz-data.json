          "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "'Compliance' or arterial distensibility refers to the ability of blood vessels to stretch in response to pressure. A decrease means that the arteries become stiffer."

          "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "Due to the fluid shift to the head, the body perceives an 'excess' of volume, which leads to the suppression of this system to promote the excretion of sodium and water."
